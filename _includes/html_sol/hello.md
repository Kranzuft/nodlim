The document type is not specified in the source for this solution, leaving the browser to enter [quirks mode][htmlmodes]. In quirks mode, the browser does the best it can to correctly display your page. In future solutions we specify ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` in the source code, which is the HTML5 document type.
