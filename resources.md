I attempted to organise this page in a reasonable order, generally trying to follow this structure:

* [beginner resources]() **FREE**
* [intermediate resources]() **FREE**
* [advanced resources]() **FREE**
* [beginner resources]() **PAID**

The exception is for references, which have been ordered alphabetically like this:
