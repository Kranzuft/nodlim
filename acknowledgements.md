# Acknowledgements

<hr>

Acknowledgements my be provided for the hard work of several open source projects used to create this website. Without them, this project would have probably died at the planning stage.

## Jekyll Site Generator

[Jekyll][jekyll] aims to provide simple, blog-aware, static sites. It is an excelent static site generator and deserves far more attention. It is used to generate this website. It is superbly great to work with.

## [@mdo's][mdo] templates for Jekyll

The jekyll template this website was built on, was [Hyde][hyde], designed by [@mdo][mdo] as an offical template for his foundational jekyll setup [Poole][poole]. Hyde, Poole and the other offical Poole template [Lanyon][lanyon], are fantastic. This website is a heavily modified version of Hyde, so check out the original [here][hyde]. [@kranzuft]({{ kranzuft_twit }}), the developer of this website, had a background in imperative programming when attempting to create this website. Hyde and Poole acted as great material to learn from, as well as build on top of, and inspired this website's design profoundly.
