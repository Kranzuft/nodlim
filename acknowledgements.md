# Acknowledgements

<hr>

Acknowledgements must be provided for the hard work of several open source projects used to create this website. Without them, this project would not exist.

## [Jekyll][jekyll-web] Site Generator

[Jekyll][jekyll-web] aims to provide simple, blog-aware, static sites. It is an excelent static site generator and deserves far more attention. It is used to generate this website, and it is great to work with.

## [@mdo's][mdo-twitter] templates for Jekyll

The jekyll template this website was built on was [Hyde][hyde-web], designed by [@mdo][mdo-twitter] as an offical template for his own foundational jekyll setup [Poole][poole-web]. Hyde and Poole helped this site blossom, acting as excellent Jekyll and CSS learning material. Hyde was easy to build on top of, and inspired nodlim's design profoundly.

## [Github Pages][gh-pages] Site Hosting

Nodlim is hosted entirely free on [github pages][gh-pages], directly through the nodlim repository on github. It works amazingly well, and works excellently with jekyll sites.
