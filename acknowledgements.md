# Acknowledgements

<hr>

Acknowledgements my be provided for the hard work of several open source projects used to create this website. Without them, this project would have probably died at the planning stage.

## Great Software Used to Further Personal Goals

1. [Jekyll][jekyll] aims to provide simple, blog-aware, static sites. It is an excelent static site generator and deserves far more attention.
2. The jekyll template this website was built on, was [Hyde][hyde], designed by [@mdo][mdo] as an offical template for his foundational jekyll setup [Poole][poole]. Hyde, Poole and the other offical Poole template [Lanyon][lanyon], are fantastic. This website is a heavily modified version of Hyde, so check out the original [here][hyde].
