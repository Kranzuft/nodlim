## The Language Choices of This Website

The shortlist of languages that are being considered for this website are the following, in very rough ordering:

1. [HTML5][html]
1. [C][c]
1. [C++11][cpp]
1. [Javascript][js]
1. [Python][py]
1. [Golang][golang]
1. [Lua][la]

The reason these languages will be prioritised over others, falls to the following criteria: 

* The language is modern
* The language is very popular
* We have some personal interest

The language that you may discern to be the most questionable inclusion, is the C programming language. The reason C has been included on this list, is both that many of these language are from the C programming language [family][cfamily], as well as that the language involves relatively more boiler plate code than the rest. These characteristics cause C to be a good language to compare other languages to, particularly because it makes seeing the benefits of code simplification and readibility in modern languages shockingly discernable, virtuous, and desirable.
