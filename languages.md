## The Language Choices of This Website

The shortlist of languages that are being considered for this website are the following, in very rough ordering:

1. [HTML5][html]
1. [Pseudocode][pseudo]
1. [Python][py]
1. [C++11][cpp]
1. [Javascript][js]
1. [Golang][golang]
1. [Lua][la]

The reason these languages will be prioritised over others, falls to the following criteria: 

* The language is modern
* The language is very popular
* Our team has personal investment
